  <h2>Portfolio Project</h2>
    <p> The Portfolio Project showcases my skills and growth in web design, highlighting key projects and concepts 
      I’ve learned. It includes an engaging "About Me" section where visitors can learn more about my background and 
      interests. The portfolio features projects such as the Choose-Your-Own Adventure, Zen Garden, and Imitation Project, 
      each with descriptions and insights into my creative process. To demonstrate my technical understanding, the site incorporates
       sample code in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For interactivity, I’ve added dynamic features like tabs, a content slideshow, and 
       playful effects that respond to user interactions, making the experience both functional and enjoyable. This project reflects 
       my >y and passion for creating interactive and user-friendly web experiences.

        <p>The Zen Garden Project is centered around transforming a single HTML file into a visually captivating design using only CSS.
           This project highlights the power of stylesheets by applying unique layouts, color schemes, typography, and imagery without altering
            the HTML structure. The goal is to create a harmonious and beautiful design that exemplifies creativity and technical skill. Through 
            this project, I demonstrate my understanding of design principles, responsive styling, and the ability to craft elegant, engaging web 
            experiences solely through CSS customization.</p> </div>

<p>The <strong>Choose-Your-Own Adventure</strong> project is an interactive web-based experience that allows users to
        make decisions that shape the outcome of a story. The project was built using <em>HTML</em>, <i>CSS</i>, and 
        to provide a seamless, dynamic experience. Users can select different paths and interact with various scenarios that
        affect the narrative, making every journey unique. The use of <b>conditional statements</b> and <strong>user input</strong> helps create
        a personalized story where the user is in control of the plot. </p></div>

        <a href="https://iacs-cs.github.io/project-imitation-arav-patel-nyjahrae-brown/"><h2>Imitation Project</h2></a>
        <p>Project Imitation focuses on translating a traditional print design into a web-based format using HTML and CSS. 
          he project emphasizes careful attention to detail, including the positioning of elements, choice of font families and weights,
           and the use of color schemes that mirror print materials. Key features of the layout include the strategic placement of images, 
           which are aligned and styled to fit the design, and a fixed footer that mimics the static nature of print layouts. By leveraging 
           techniques like flexbox for element alignment and ensuring the design remains coherent, Project Imitation serves as a practice in 
           translating print aesthetics into the digital realm while maintaining readability and a visually engaging experience.
