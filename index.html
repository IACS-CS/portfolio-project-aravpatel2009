          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>

        <h2>Zen Garden Project</h2>
        <p>In this project, we had to use only CSS to create a design. We couldn't modify the HTML. I experimented with typography, backgrounds, colors, and the layout of the menu to create a visually appealing design.</p>
        <h2>Choose-Your-Own Adventure Project</h2>
         <p>The <strong>Choose-Your-Own Adventure</strong> project is an interactive web-based experience that allows users to
        make decisions that shape the outcome of a story. The project was built using <em>HTML</em>, <i>CSS</i>, and 
        to provide a seamless, dynamic experience. Users can select different paths and interact with various scenarios that
        affect the narrative, making every journey unique. The use of <b>conditional statements</b> and <strong>user input</strong> helps create
        a personalized story where the user is in control of the plot. </p>
        <h2>Imitation Project</h2>
        <p>Project Imitation focuses on translating a traditional print design into a web-based format using HTML and CSS. The project emphasizes careful attention to detail, including the positioning of elements, choice of font families and weights, and the use of color schemes that mirror print materials. Key features of the layout include the strategic placement of images, which are aligned and styled to fit the design, and a fixed footer that mimics the static nature of print layouts. By leveraging techniques like flexbox for element alignment and ensuring the design remains coherent, Project Imitation serves as a practice in translating print aesthetics into the digital realm while maintaining readability and a visually engaging experience.
